  List all routes


  route entities define rules to match client requests. Each route is associated with a service, and a service may have multiple routes associated to it. Every request matching a given route will be proxied to its associated service.


  Note: Path handling algorithms v1 was deprecated in Kong 3.0. From Kong 3.0, when router_flavor is set to expressions, route.path_handling will be unconfigurable and the path handling behavior will be "v0"; when router_flavor is set to traditional_compatible, the path handling behavior will be "v0" regardless of the value of route.path_handling. Only router_flavor = traditional will support path_handling "v1' behavior.
