description: >
  A plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed during
  the HTTP request/response lifecycle. Plugins let you add functionality to
  services that run behind a Kong Gateway instance, like authentication or rate
  limiting.

  You can find more information about available plugins and which values each plugin accepts at the [Plugin Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/).

  <br><br>

  When adding a plugin configuration to a service, the plugin will run on every request made by a client to that service. If a plugin needs to be tuned to different values for some specific consumers, you can do so by creating a separate plugin instance that specifies both the service and the consumer, through the service and consumer fields.

  <br><br>

  Plugins can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/admin-api/#tags).

    **Bracket syntax for keys with periods:**
    When submitting form data, keys that contain dots (e.g., `service.name`) should be enclosed in square brackets to avoid ambiguity:
    
    - Example: `config.resource_attributes[service.name]=kong-dev`
    
    - If necessary, URL encode the square brackets: `%5Bservice.name%5D`.
