description: >
  Service entities are abstractions of your microservice interfaces or formal
  APIs. For example, a service could be a data transformation microservice or a
  billing API.

  <br><br>

  The main attribute of a service is the destination URL for proxying traffic. This URL can be set as a single string or by specifying its protocol, host, port and path individually. 

  <br><br>

  Services are associated to routes, and a single service can have many routes associated with it. Routes are entrypoints in Kong Gateway which define rules to match client requests. Once a route is matched, Kong Gateway proxies the request to its associated service. See the [Proxy Reference](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/how-kong-works/routing-traffic/) for a detailed explanation of how Kong proxies traffic.

  <br><br>

  Services can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/admin-api/#tags).
