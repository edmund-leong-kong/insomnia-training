  Kong Gateway's RBAC feature is configurable through Kong's Admin API or using
  Kong Manager.

  <br><br>

  There are four basic entities involving RBAC:

  <br><br>

  * User: The entity interacting with the system. Can be associated with zero, one, or more roles. For example: The user `bob` has the token `1234`.

  * Role: Set of permissions (`role_endpoint` and `role_entity`). Has a name and can be associated with zero, one, or more permissions. For example: The user `bob` is associated with the role `developer`.

  * `role_source`: The origin of the RBAC user role. Specifies where the user role is defined, either locally or through an identity provider (IdP).

  * `role_endpoint`: A set of enabled or disabled actions. For example: The role `developer` has one `role_endpoint` and reads and writes to `/routes`.

  * `role_entity`: A set of enabled or disabled actions. For example: The role `developer` has one `role_entity` attached to a UUID.

  For the admin role in the default workspace, CRUD actions on /groups and /groups/* endpoints are disallowed. 

  For the workspace-admin role in non-default workspaces, CRUD actions on /groups and /groups/* endpoints are disallowed.
