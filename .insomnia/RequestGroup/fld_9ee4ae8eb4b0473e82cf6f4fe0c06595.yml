description: >
  A target is an IP address or hostname with a port that identifies an instance
  of a backend service. Every upstream can have many targets, and the targets
  can be dynamically added, modified, or deleted. Changes take effect on the
  fly.

  <br><br>

  To disable a target, post a new one with `weight=0`, or use the `DELETE` method to accomplish the same.
