description: >
  Route entities define rules to match client requests. Each route is associated
  with a service, and a service may have multiple routes associated to it. Every
  request matching a given route will be proxied to the associated service. You
  need at least one matching rule that applies to the protocol being matched by
  the route.

  <br><br>

  The combination of routes and services, and the separation of concerns between them, offers a powerful routing mechanism with which it is possible to define fine-grained entrypoints in Kong Gateway leading to different upstream services of your infrastructure.

  <br><br>

  Depending on the protocol, one of the following attributes must be set:

  <br>

  * `http`: At least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`

  * `https`:  At least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`

  *  `tcp`: At least one of `sources` or `destinations`

  * `tls`: at least one of `sources`, `destinations`, or `snis`

  * `tls_passthrough`: set `snis`

  * `grpc`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`

  * `grpcs`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`

  * `ws`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`

  * `wss`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis` 

  <br>


  A route can't have both `tls` and `tls_passthrough` protocols at same time.
