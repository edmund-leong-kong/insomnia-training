description: >
  A certificate object represents a public certificate, and can be optionally
  paired with the corresponding private key. These objects are used by Kong
  Gateway to handle SSL/TLS termination for encrypted requests, or for use as a
  trusted CA store when validating peer certificate of client/service. 

  <br><br>

  Certificates are optionally associated with SNI objects to tie a cert/key pair to one or more hostnames. 

  <br><br>

  If intermediate certificates are required in addition to the main certificate, they should be concatenated together into one string.
