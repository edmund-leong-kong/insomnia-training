description: >
  The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to load
  balance incoming requests over multiple services (targets). 

  <br><br>

  An upstream also includes a [health checker](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/how-kong-works/health-checks/), which can enable and disable targets based on their ability or inability to serve requests. 

  The configuration for the health checker is stored in the upstream object, and applies to all of its targets.
