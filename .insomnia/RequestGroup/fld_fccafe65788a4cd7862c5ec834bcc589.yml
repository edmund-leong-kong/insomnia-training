  Vault objects are used to configure different vault connectors for [managing
  secrets](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/secrets-management/). 

  Configuring a vault lets you reference secrets from other entities.

  This allows for a proper separation of secrets and configuration and prevents secret sprawl. 

  <br><br>

  For example, you could store a certificate and a key in a vault, then reference them from a certificate entity. This way, the certificate and key are not stored in the entity directly and are more secure.

  <br><br>

  Secrets rotation can be managed using [TTLs](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/secrets-management/advanced-usage/).
